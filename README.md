That app was a small project of mine to test openGl functionality. I've planned to make a small library to make a 3d simulations, but there are many other, so I'm not sure if there is any point in doing that.

# Description
This app is just a simple 3d rubik cube, which allows user to play a little with it.

Here are the controlls:

To rotate the cube walls use:
`q`, `w`, `e`,
`a`, `s`, `b`,
`z`, `x`, `c`

To rotate viewport use `arrow keys`.

To switch direction of rotation use `space`.

It was only a test project, so If you wants to use it (or any part of it), feel free. 
The app is under the 0BSD license.
